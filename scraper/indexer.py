"""
indexer.py  —  Robust IIT Jammu Knowledge Index Builder
=========================================================
Converts data/raw/*.md  →  data/processed/iitj_index.json

PROBLEMS SOLVED vs old version:
  1. HTML fragments in good files → deep HTML stripper
  2. Misclassification (faculty→Academic, placement→Admissions) → better scorer
  3. Duplicate content → SHA-256 fingerprint dedup
  4. Empty/tiny nodes polluting the tree → min content threshold
  5. section extraction breaking on repeated headings → dedup heading content
  6. Topic nodes with 100+ children → sub-group by department/sub-topic
  7. Missing key facts (fee, hostel, placement) → hardcoded seed nodes merged in
  8. Bad summaries (just "IIT Jammu...") → stronger TF-IDF + factual-line preference
  9. total_nodes count wrong → count at end after tree is fully built
  10. Indexer crashes on malformed MD → try/except on every file

USAGE:
  python indexer.py           # offline TF-IDF summaries (instant)
  python indexer.py --stats   # show stats without writing
  python indexer.py --dry-run # build but don't save

OUTPUT:
  data/processed/iitj_index.json
